### Further Explanation

Given the fact that this project depends on Maven to download and use dependencies from the JavaFX
library to act as our frontend framework, we were unable to collect all files into a single Build
directory, as Maven requires its pom.xml metadata file to be hosted under the main directory 
of this project.
